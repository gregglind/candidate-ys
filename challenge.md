# Purpose:

YourStake provides data on social and environmental issues to allow investors to decide which companies best align with their values. One of our goals is to gather global toxic air pollution data to tie to corporate entities in a methodologically consistent manner. Toxic air pollution reporting to global Pollution Release Transfer Registries (PRTRs) allows us to standardize toxic air pollution metrics for companies across geographical regions.

# Goal:

1. Using the language and libraries of your choice, write code to produce a CSV of company names, amount of toxic air pollution, and description of details (e.g. facility locations, purpose of facility, names of chemicals releasedâ€¦).
2. Describe the steps you'd take to make your script robust enough to run unsupervised on a regular basis.
3. List of quality checks you would want to write when putting into web app, and bullet point outline of how.
 
Be prepared to discuss your process, and what challenges you encountered. If you get stuck, tell us what part is impossible and why, or come up with some creative workaround. We suggest that you spend 3-5 hours on this task.
