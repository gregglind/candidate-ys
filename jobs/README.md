# Creating New Datasets

All "job" folders have the same structure:

```
.
├── README.md            # specific instructions for this job
├── artifacts/           # created artifacts
├── code/                # datset generating code
├── downloads/           # temporary downloaded files
├── logs/                # logging for success and failure
└── observability.yaml   # spec for observability (See question 2/3)
```
